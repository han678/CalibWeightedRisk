This repository contains the code for the paper **"A Novel Characterization of the Population Area Under the Risk Coverage Curve (AURC) and Rates of Finite Sample Estimators"** [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23463)].

#### Key Dependencies
To run the code, you will need the following dependencies (excluding common packages like `scipy`, `numpy`, and `torch`):

- **Python** â‰¥ 3.8
- **torchsort**: A library that implements fast, differentiable sorting and ranking in PyTorch. [Learn more here](https://github.com/google-research/fast-soft-sort).

  Install via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install torchsort
  ```

#### Preparing Datasets and Models

- **Tiny-ImageNet**
- **CIFAR-10/100**
  -  Place the downloaded files in the `data` folder.

#### Using the AURC loss in your project

To evaluate AURC using our estimator, you can copy the file `loss/aurc.py` into your repository. 

#### Visualizing the performance of AURC loss

To train the model with AURC loss, use the following commands:
```bash
python train.py
```
